## Deployment notes

This project has a static frontend (served from `login/`, `mainpage/`, `mainmenu/`, etc.) and an Express backend in `server/index.js` used for reCAPTCHA verification and admin endpoints. For production, host the backend on a public URL and set the frontend `API_BASE` at runtime so the client can call the correct API.
